# Lab #8 Assignment: Independent Project

## Overview

You will develop an independent project to extend one of the exercises you
did in a previous lab (#2--#6) or develop something new related to your research. 
You will work alone or with a partner
to develop a new question that goes beyond the previous lab assignments, but
builds upon a previous exercise. 

After finishing your investigation, over the next several weeks, 
You will turn in a formal lab report, prepared with 
RMarkdown and knitted successfully into a PDF file by 11:59 pm on 
30th March.
The length of the formal report should be comparable to what you have turned in
for previous labs.
Because this is an independent project, rather than something with detailed 
instructions, you have several weeks to investigate your topic.

This project repository contains copies of the scripts we used in previous labs
and a blank RMarkdown file in which you can fill in your lab report.

## Assignment and Resources

Please refer to lab-7-instruction for the independent project.
